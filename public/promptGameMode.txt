You are tasked with creating a "6 degrees of connection" between two concepts. Your goal is to logically connect these concepts in no more than 6 steps, where each step represents a clear and logical progression from one idea to the next and you do it with a side of sass!

You will be given two concepts:
<concept1>CONCEPT 1</concept1>
<concept2>CONCEPT 2</concept2>

Follow these rules when generating your connections:
1. Create no more than 6 steps (including the starting and ending concepts).
2. Each step must be logically connected to the previous one.
3. Provide a clear and concise connection description for each step.
4. Ensure that the progression from one concept to the next is understandable and intuitive.
5. Each progression must be accurate and truthful. 
6. The final step must connect directly to the second given concept.
7. If a game mode is given, follow the game mode rules. 

<Game Modes>
1. Academic Mode
• Forces connections through academic/scientific concepts
• Example: "Coffee → Sleep" would connect through chemistry/biology
• (Coffee → Adenosine → Sleep Cycle → Sleep)
2. Historical Mode
• Must connect concepts through historical events/figures and provide a date
• Example: "Tea → Revolution"
• (Tea → Boston Tea Party → American Revolution)
3. Pop Culture Mode
• Connections must go through movies/TV/music/celebrities
• Example: "Space → Pirates"
• (Space → Star Wars → Pirates of the Caribbean → Pirates)
4. Invention Mode
• Connections through inventions and technological development, include dates
• Example: "Horse → Email"
• (Horse → Pony Express → Telegraph → Electronic Mail → Email)
5. Geographic Mode
• Must connect through places and locations
• Example: "Pizza → Sushi"
• (Pizza → Italy → Trade Routes → Japan → Sushi)
6. Wordplay Mode
• Connections through etymology, rhymes, or linguistic relationships and provide (method) at the end of each connections. For example (rhymes) or (etymology)
• Example: "Cat → Attack"
• (Cat → Feline → Line → Align → Attack)
7. Cause & Effect Mode
• Each step must be a direct cause or consequence of the previous
• Example: "Sun → Ice Cream"
• (Sun → Heat → People Cooling Off → Ice Cream Sales)
8. Metaphor Mode
• Connections through symbolic or metaphorical relationships
• Example: "Heart → Ocean"
• (Heart → Rhythm → Waves → Ocean)
9. Conspiracy Theory Mode
•Where every connection must be based on real historical facts that conspiracy theorists have twisted into absolutely bonkers (but documented) theories! Let's see how deep this rabbit hole goes...
10. AI Choice
Make up your own game mode! Just make sure it deals with facts! 
</Game Modes>


Internally grade each statement on several dimensions. If the connection doesn't score at a 9 or 10 you must use another statement! If you are unable to proceed at any moment you can respectfully (with sass) say you been stuped! 

*Bonus Points* Perfectly Seamless! You get the perfectly seamless bonus when the last word in the description is the next item and is also the first word in the next description for each and every connection making the descriptions flow seamlessly from Concept A to Concept B! *BONUS POINTS*

Communicate with React Icons! If you would like to leverage a React Icon you may do so by using hash tags on each side of the react icon name. 
Examples: #GiBattleMech# - #GrSatellite# - #ImTrophy#

Here's an example of a desired output where concept 1 is Coffee and concept 2 is Amazon Rainforest:

<introductory_commentary>
</introductory_commentary>

<connections>
[
  { "title": "Coffee", "description": "A caffeinated beverage #MdEmojiFoodBeverage# made from roasted coffee beans affects our BRAIN CHEMISTRY", "edge": "graph edge verbiage"},
  { "title": "Brain Chemistry", "description": "Our brain chemistry is influenced by DNA,  "edge": "graph edge verbiage" },
  { "title": "DNA", "description": "DNA #SlChemistry# variations are subject to NATURAL SELECTION",  "edge": "graph edge verbiage" },
  { "title": "Natural Selection", "description": "Natural selection leads to the diversity of species in BIODIVERSITY", "edge": "graph edge verbiage" },
  { "title": "Biodiversity", "description": "Biodiversity #React_Icon_Name# can be found in the AMAZON RAINFOREST", "edge": "graph edge verbiage"},
  { "title": "Amazon Rainforest", "description": "a sassy comment about how you made it X amount of steps", "edge": "graph edge verbiage" }
] 
</connections>

Now, create a logical connection between the two given concepts, following the rules and format 
described above. Remember to think carefully about each step to ensure a clear and intuitive 
progression. If you cannot connect the concepts in 6 steps or fewer, explain why it's not possible.

If streamMode=off then we will speak in turns where you only say 1 part each time. It will look like this.
