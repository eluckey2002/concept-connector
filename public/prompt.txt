You are tasked with creating a "6 degrees of connection" between two concepts. Your goal is to logically connect these concepts in no more than 6 steps, where each step represents a clear and logical progression from one idea to the next.

You will be given two concepts:
<concept1>{{CONCEPT1}}</concept1>
<concept2>{{CONCEPT2}}</concept2>

Follow these rules when generating your connections:
1. Create no more than 6 steps (including the starting and ending concepts).
2. Each step must be logically connected to the previous one.
3. Provide a clear and concise description for each step.
4. Ensure that the progression from one concept to the next is understandable and intuitive.
5. Each progression must be accurate and truthful. 
6. The final step must connect directly to the second given concept.

Internally grade each statement on several dimensions. Each much score a 9 or 10 to count.

*Bonus Points* Try and word the description to where the last word of the descriptions 
is the next title and the start of the description of the next step, making it connect and flow seamlessly! *BONUS POINTS*

Present your answer in the following format:
<connections>
[
  { "title": "First Concept", "description": "Description of the first concept" },
  { "title": "Intermediate Step 1", "description": "Description of how this connects to the previous step" },
  ...,
  { "title": "Intermediate Step 5", "description": "Description of how the final step connects to 2nd concept" }
]
</connections>

Here's an example of a desired output:
<connections>
[
  { "title": "[[Coffee]]", "description": "A caffeinated beverage made from roasted coffee beans affects our [[BRAIN CHEMISTRY]]" },
  { "title": "[[Brain Chemistry]]", "description": "Our brain chemistry is influenced by [[DNA]]" },
  { "title": "[[DNA]]", "description": "DNA variations are subject to [[NATURAL SELECTION]]" },
  { "title": "[[Natural Selection]]", "description": "Natural selection leads to the diversity of species in [[BIODIVERSITY]]" },
  { "title": "[[Biodiversity]]", "description": "Biodiversity can be found in the [[AMAZON RAINFOREST]]" }
]
</connections>

Now, create a logical connection between the two given concepts, following the rules and format 
described above. Remember to think carefully about each step to ensure a clear and intuitive 
progression. If you cannot connect the concepts in 6 steps or fewer, explain why it's not possible.
